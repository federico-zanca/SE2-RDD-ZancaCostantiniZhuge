\label{sec: sim}%
Two simulations of the built model are presented below.
The first one is the simpler one, it's useful to understand the general ideas behind the model and the relations between elements.
The second world is more complex as it was simulated forcing Alloy to generate more entities (Tournaments, Battles, Teams, Badges, etc.) 
in order to give a deeper insight of the model.
