\subsection{Class Diagrams}
\label{subsec:class_diagrams}%
The diagram below represents and describes the classes involved in the system, their basic functionalities, attributes,
and the relationships between them.
From the diagram, it is easy to see how the tournament entity function as a bridge between different
components. More specifically, in our design we assigned to this entity the task to hold track 
of battles, leaderboard of the tournament itself and badge assignment.
All the other functionalities are esily understandable from within the diagram or 
will be later discussed. \newline
Here, we want to stress that, even though just an high level view of the system-to-be, some consideration of implementation can be done. 
More specifically, some design pattern can be taken into consideration:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Decorator Pattern: to implement the logic behind the scoring system. Educator's choice of different aspect to consider will be easily managable 
    \item Observer patter: to implement the structure behind the notification system.
    \item Factory pattern: for the creation of different Badges with different characteristics and requirements.
  \end{itemize}

\paragraph{Unregistered student creates an account.}
Gianmarco is a computer science student from Politecnico of Milan. After attending several courses about software engineering, 
he is looking for a way to practice his skills. Fortunately, one of his professor suggests him the CodeKataBattle platform.
Gianmarco immediately proceeds to create an account. He navigates to the platform and goes to the "sign up" section. 
The system asks Gianmarco some personal information such as first and last name, an email linked 
to an institutional profile (for example name.surname@mail.polimi.it). He receives an e-mail with a 
6-digit code to be in inserted in the web page to confirm his e-mail address. In the meanwhile, the platform 
receives information about the status of Gianmarco from the university (wether he is a teacher or a student). 
After accepting the terms \& conditions 
and submitting an username for his profile, the system creates his account, and Gianmarco can begin to use the platform.

\paragraph*{User Logs in.}
Emily, the coding enthusiast, is all set for her daily dose of challenges on the CodeKataBattle (CKB) platform. 
To embark on her coding adventure, she clicks the login button and enters her institutional email.
The platform asks Emily to provide the password for her account. 
Excited and confident, Emily types in her password, which is verified by the platform to ensure it matches the email/password combination for the user.
With a successful password match, the platform welcomes Emily to her homepage; she's now ready to dive into the coding battles.
In case there's a typo in her email or a hiccup during password verification, the platform gently guides Emily through the process, ensuring a seamless login experience.

\section{User characteristics}
\label{sec:user_characteristics}%
The CKB platform caters to various user roles, each with specific responsibilities and access levels:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Guest:}  Users who are not registered on the CKB platform but have the potential to become either students or educators. 
    Guests have limited access and functionality until they complete the registration process. 
    Once registered, they can assume the roles of either Student or Educator based on their role in the institution they belong to.
    \item \textbf{Educator:} Educators who have successfully registered within the CKB system. Identified by a unique identifier, registered educators, depending on permissions granted, may assume the role of Tournament Administrator. 
    They possess the ability to create CKBs, evaluate student submissions, and engage in other system functionalities.
    \item \textbf{Student:} Users, both registered and unregistered, participating in code kata battles facilitated by the CKB platform. 
    Students can form teams, submit solutions, and engage in the competition. 
    Their scores, rankings, and achievements contribute to their overall performance, visible in the context of tournaments.
    \item \textbf{Tournament Administrator:} Educators with privileges to perform actions within a specific Tournament. Tournament Administrators, typically the creators of a Tournament, can delegate administrative powers to other educators. 
    These administrators have the authority to initiate new CKBs, evaluate submissions, and oversee tournament-related activities.
