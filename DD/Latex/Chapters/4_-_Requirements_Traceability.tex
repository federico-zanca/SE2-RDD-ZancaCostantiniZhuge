This chapter shows how the functional and non-functional requirements of the CKB platform described in the RASD are met.
Firstly, we describe the mapping between the requirements listed in the 3.2.1 \textit{Requirements} section in the RASD
and the components identified in section 2.2 of this document.
Then, we comment on how \textit{Performance Requirements} and \textit{Software System Attributes} described in the 3.3
and 3.5 sections of the RASD are met thanks to the design adopted for the CKB platform.


\section{Functional Requirements Traceability}
\label{sec: functional_requirements_traceability}%
The following table lists all the requirements that are satisfied by the components.
Texts of the requirements are inserted in the table to facilitate comprehension.
