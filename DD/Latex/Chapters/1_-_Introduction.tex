\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the CodeKataBattle (\verb|CKB|) platform, elucidating the strategies to meet the project requirements delineated in the Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD). 
Tailored for developers and testers, this document serves as a guide, offering a functional delineation of the system's components, their interactions, interfaces, and the planned implementation strategies.
For developers, the document acts as a guide, providing a closer look at the details of CKB's architecture and design choices.
Testers will find valuable information on the expected functionalities and the interaction patterns within the system.
Furthermore, this document serves as a bridge between the abstraction of the concepts in the RASD and the concrete implementation detailed here. 
It addresses each requirement outlined in the RASD, explaining how the various system components, described herein, collectively fulfill these requirements. 
This document aims to enhance comprehension of how the \verb|CKB| platform meets the specified project objectives by detailing its internal workings and external interfaces.

\section{Document Structure}
\label{sec:document_structure}

The structure of this Design Document is organized into seven distinct sections, each contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the CodeKataBattle (CKB) platform.

The opening section (Introduction) serves as a preamble, introducing the purposes and objectives of the document. 
It also includes a compilation of abbreviations and definitions used to enhance the readability of the document.

The second section (Architectural Design) delves into the chosen architectural design for CKB. 
It describes the identified system components, their interrelations, communication interfaces, behavioral aspects within the system, and the utilization of architectural styles.

The third section (User Interface Design) focuses on user interfaces, presenting and elucidating the mockups designed to enhance the user experience on the CKB platform.

Section four (Requirements Traceability) systematically demonstrates how the CKB system aligns with the defined requirements. 
It begins by establishing a mapping between identified components and the functional requirements outlined in the third section of the RASD. 
Subsequently, a detailed account of the fulfillment of performance requirements and system attributes is provided.

The fifth section (Implementation, Integration, and Test Plan) outlines the plan for implementing, integrating, and testing various subcomponents of the CKB system. 
It details the sequence in which subcomponents will be implemented and integrated, setting the groundwork for the practical realization of the platform.

Section six (Effort Spent) provides transparency regarding the effort invested by each group member in the creation of this document. 

The concluding section serves as a repository of bibliography references and additional resources utilized in the creation of this Design Document.
