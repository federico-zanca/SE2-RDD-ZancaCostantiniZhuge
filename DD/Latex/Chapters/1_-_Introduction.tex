\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the CodeKataBattle (\verb|CKB|) platform, elucidating the strategies to meet the project requirements delineated in the Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD). 
Tailored for developers and testers, this document serves as a guide, offering a functional delineation of the system's components, their interactions, interfaces, and the planned implementation strategies.
For developers, the document acts as a guide, providing a closer look at the details of CKB's architecture and design choices.
Testers will find valuable information on the expected functionalities and the interaction patterns within the system.
Furthermore, this document serves as a bridge between the abstraction of the concepts in the RASD and the concrete implementation detailed here. 
It addresses each requirement outlined in the RASD, explaining how the various system components, described herein, collectively fulfill these requirements. 
This document aims to enhance comprehension of how the \verb|CKB| platform meets the specified project objectives by detailing its internal workings and external interfaces.
